# Madcatz TE2 Mixbox Panel
Vector files for a DIY mixbox arcade controller mod for Madcatz TE2

Please read this throughly befoe making any decisions.

There are two files:
* mixbox_te2_metal_panel.dxf - required, the metal control panel that holds the switches and buttons
* mixbox_te2_plexi_panel.dxf - optional but recommended, clear panel to slide artwork under

Do note that the holes on the must be chamfered so that screws sit flushed with the metal control panel. The file provided *will not be chamfered* and you are required to do this with some tools (hand drill or drill press).
The steps below are what I recommend you do if you are ordering all these parts online:

Order the metal panel from [Laserboost](https://www.laserboost.com/) with the following configurations:
* Material: 304 Stainless Steel Unfinished (you can decide, but this is the cheaper option)
* Thickness: 1.5 mm
* Size: 304 x 179 mm
* Path Length: 2094 mm

After recieving the metal panel, you must chamfer the screw holes in order for the scews to sit flushed. I've done this using a hand drill mounted in a drill press-like rig, eyeballing and checking until the screw sits flushed.

Order the plexi panel from [Ponoko](https://make.ponoko.com) with the following configurations:
* Material: Clear PETG
* Thickness: 1.0 mm
* Size: 331.50 x 202.20 mm

You have two options on Material and Thickness depending on what you need. Some TE2 models come with [button spacers](https://focusattack.com/t-e-2-spacer-for-sanwa-30mm-obs-series-pushbuttons-8-pak/), which I would recommend using the above configurations for the best fit. However if you don't have the spacers or choose to not use them, you can ty ordering the following configurations below:
* Material: Clear Acrylic
* Thickness: 1.5 mm
* Size: 331.50 x 202.20 mm

Another huge concern to note, I've made some untested dimension adjustments to the plexi panel. Long story short, the first time I designed the files, the plexi dimensions were a bit too big and I had to trim it down with scissors. I have resized it using some error-prone measuring tools (crappy calipers) but have not tested it by reordering. If you order the plexi material as PETG, it will be very easy to trim down with scissors if you find that it still fits a little too big. Let me know how it goes if you are trying out this panel mod.

Good luck!
