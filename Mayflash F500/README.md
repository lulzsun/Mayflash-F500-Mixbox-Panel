# Mayflash F500 Mixbox Panel
Vector files for a DIY mixbox arcade controller mod for Mayflash F500

There are two different versions:
* ponoko_f500_mixbox_v1.svg - has rounded key edges
* ponoko_f500_mixbox_v2.svg - has sharp key edges

These files are ready to be uploaded to [Ponoko](https://make.ponoko.com) to be laser cut. 
Here is the configuration for ordering:

* Acrylic - Clear 
* 2mm (0.080 inches)

You will also need new mounting screws:
* M3 x 12mm - Socket or Phillips head 
> (If you are using 0.118 thickness, M3 x 14mm should work better)

# Notes
I recommend you to use 2mm (0.080 inches) plexi thickness because 3mm (0.118 inches) bulges out of the top a little bit.

Originally, the stock front plexiglass is 3mm while the control panel is 2mm. But with these vector files, I have put both the plexiglass and the control panel onto the same sheet, so when you order on Ponoko (or anywhere else), you save on costs by only ordering one sheet of plexiglass and not two of different thicknesses. If you want to be perfect, you can edit the vector file, seperate the control panel and front plexiglass into two files, then have them cut out on their own original thickness. 

2.5mm plexi thickness might be the best option if you can source it. 2mm might not sit completely flush. Let me know the results if you end up trying 2.5mm.
